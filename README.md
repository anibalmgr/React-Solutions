# Playground

Here I try code and features that I am learning. I started with some very simple react router features and I thought I can just make a new react module for every new thing that I want to try. I'll try to keep things organised so it can be, hopefully, useful for others.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## [Effects](https://github.com/anibalmgr/playground/blob/main/src/Effects.jsx)

Here I was trying [useEffect](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html) to scroll to the top, the actual implementation of this is in a website using ReactRouter and the scroll element wasn't the window DOM element, but a div that wrapped the content of the page, so the header and footer are always visible. I needed a simpler environment to try that before to implement it in the real project.
