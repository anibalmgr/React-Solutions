# Experiments

Here I try all that code and features that I am learning. I started with some very simple react router features and I thought I can just make a new react module for every new thing that I want to try.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Effects

Here I was trying to use effects to scroll to the top, the actual implementation of this is in a website using ReactRouter and the scroll element wasn't the window DOM element, but a div that wrapped the content of the page, so the header and footer are always visible. I needed a simpler environment to try that before to implement it in the real project.
